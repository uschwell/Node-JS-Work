// This file is ex3_1a.js , by modifing file script2.js to work in asynchronous manner
// in this solution , after an html button is clicked, the script will run and begin sending
// url requests to the server without waiting for the completion (response) of the previous request, 
// the next request in order is built and sent (in a fully asynchronous manner)
